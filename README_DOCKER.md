# Documentation: How to Start with Docker Compose

1. **Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are Installed**:
    - Verify that Docker is installed on your system by running `docker --version`.
    - Check Docker Compose installation by running `docker-compose --version`.

2. **Prepare the `docker-compose.yml` File**:
    - Ensure you have a `docker-compose.yml` file in your project directory.
    - This file should define the services, networks, and volumes required for your container.

3. **Start the Container**:
    - Navigate to the directory containing the `docker-compose.yml` file.
    - Run the following command to start the container:
      ```bash
      docker-compose up
      ```
    - This command will build and start the services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

4. **Run in Detached Mode (Optional)**:
    - To run the container in the background, use the `-d` flag:
      ```bash
      docker-compose up -d
      ```

5. **Stop the Container**:
    - To stop the running container, use the following command:
      ```bash
      docker-compose down
      ```

6. **Additional Notes**:
    - If you make changes to the `docker-compose.yml` file, you may need to rebuild the services using:
      ```bash
      docker-compose up --build
      ```
    - Logs can be viewed in real-time by running:
      ```bash
      docker-compose logs -f
      ```

This documentation provides a step-by-step guide to manage containers using Docker Compose.
